Biography:

I earned earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Minnesota in 2017 in Sociology and History with minors in Asian American Studies, Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies in the United States, and Statistics. I am currently a doctoral student in the Sociology Department at Indiana University studying race, immigration, political culture, and quantitative/computational methodology.

My work focuses on how individuals make sense of social categorization. By understanding the schemas through which individuals conceptualize race, I argue sociologists and policy-makers can better understand racial attitude in social surveys and how people make sense of racialized policy and racial justice. Additionally, I use social media data to analyze patterns of political dicourse and hate speech during the 2016 presidental election campaign.

Additionally, I am passionate about methodology and methodological education. I am one of the co-coordinators for the Compuatioanl Social Science working group in the Sociology Department at Indiana University and coordinator workshops in statistical software for graduate students. I think about how sociologists can utilize computational lingiustics, quanitative text analysis, network analysis, and machine learning to test social theories and make sense of society. I am currently working on projects on using machine learning to automate coding for social texts (social media posts) and operationalizing ties in discourse/text networks. Additionally, I utilize schematic class/network analysis techniques in my substantive work on conceptualization of race.
